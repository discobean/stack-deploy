# stack-deploy
Stack deploy script helps when deploying stacks json or yaml to cloudformation

## Install
````
pip install stack-deploy
````

## examples (diff before run)
1. Create templates, they would be .yaml or .json files
2. Go into your template files directory, and run it:

````
cd mystackdir
stack-deploy -f *
````

This will print a diff of any changes that will be made to your CF stacks

## examples (update the stack)
Same as above, but run `stack-deploy -f * -u`, which will update the stacks

If there are no diffs, then no update-stack command will be run

## Build notes
````
python setup.py sdist
twine upload dist/*
````
